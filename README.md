## Orchard Frontend Developer Exam Project

## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Jan Brian Villamayor and I'm excited to present this project that I developed for the Orchard Frontend Developer Exam.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
7. npm run start

### Some notes:

- i used React.Js and Bootstrap for the development of this project.
- i decided to use react because its more efficient, modern, easy to divide components into parts and have a good developer experience using it,
- i also use typescript so that i can see the defects early while on the development.
- i decided to use bootstrap cause it is bare and theres not much override needed to the core styling.
- the app is responsive and tested using the chrome dev tools.
- i also deployed this to vercel, it can be access here https://orchard-jbpv-mzsmpmk04-iamjbpvs-projects.vercel.app/
